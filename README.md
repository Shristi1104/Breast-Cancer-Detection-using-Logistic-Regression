🩺 Breast Cancer Detection using Logistic Regression 🧠📊
This project focuses on detecting breast cancer using Logistic Regression. Here’s a brief overview:

:dna: Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset with features like radius, texture, and compactness.

:gear: Preprocessing: Data cleaning, normalization, and splitting into training and test sets.

:chart_with_upwards_trend: Model Training: Logistic regression to classify tumors as malignant or benign.

:bar_chart: Evaluation: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC to assess performance.

:rocket: Goal: Build an efficient, interpretable ML model for healthcare applications.
